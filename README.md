This repository contains code for real-time classification of industrial objects

It uses basic computer vision methods for segmentation of fasteners (namely bolts and screws) on a conveyor belt. Using the contour detection results, it feeds the classification model with the bounding box of the fasteners. It also makes use of a second view for multi-view classification of the fasteners.
